1: How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you spent more time on it? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.

I spent about 30 hours, at least half of the time spent was reading / learning as I have never used Ratpack before, or Jedis in this way ( installing on my windows machine was interesting to learn).
I would add more validation / verification of requests as currently it does not verify currency correctness, or restrict negative balances etc. I would also add more testing but found it hard to locate documentation on java ratpack testing.


2: What was the most useful feature that was added to Java 8? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it.

I like The JavaTime Api , it is much easier to manage time operations. I also like lambda operations (in moderation) used in the test task.
 

What is your favourite framework / library / package that you love but couldn't use in the task? What do you like about it so much?

I don't think I have a favourite but I found myself spring boot a little during this test. Possibly just down to familiarity.

What great new thing you learnt about in the past year and what are you looking forward to learn more about over the next year?

Ratpack :-)

How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this? Can you add anything to your implementation to help with this?

Ideally performance tests would be created and executed prior to release and on a regular basis. For this I have used LoadRunner in the past.
In my current position we use New Relic that enables us to see for example slow db queries, or excess jvm / thread usage etc.


How would you improve the APIs that you just used?

Validation would be the first thing I would look at.
